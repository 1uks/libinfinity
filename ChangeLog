2007-03-15  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-xml-connection.h: 
	* libinfinity/inf-xml-connection.c: Added an InfXmlConnection
	interface that replaces GNetworkConnection.

	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.h: Made a property out of the read-only
	functions and signal.

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Replaced VOID:BOOLEAN by VOID:POINTER
	for InfXmlConnection.

	* libinfinity/inf-net-object.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-note-plugin.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-session.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-net-object.c:

	* libinfinity/inf-session.c:
	* libinfinited/infd-session.c:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c: Adjusted to use InfXmlConnection
	instead of GNetworkConnection.

	* configure.ac:
	* libinfinity/Makefile.am:
	* libinfinited/Makefile.am: Dropped dependency on libgnetwork. Also
	excluded infd-server.[hc] from build because they would still require
	GNetworkServer. Another interface in libinfinited is required here.

2007-03-15  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinited/infd-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-storage.c: Turned the path field of
	InfdStorageNode to name.

	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c: Implemented remaining functionality
	that was missing, some more enhanced operations like copying or moving
	nodes are still not supported, though.

2007-03-12  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinited/infd-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-storage.c: Renamed InfdDirectoryStorage to
	InfdStorage.

2007-03-12  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-user.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-user.c: Removed connection field again. I don't
	think it is useful.

	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Added
	inf_session_get_synchronization_status() and an exclude parameter to
	the validate_user_props vfunc.

	* libinfinity/inf-error.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-error.c:
	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: These specify some error codes that are
	commonly used by client and server.

2007-03-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Connect to notify::status to find out
	when a connection is closed.

2007-03-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Provide getters for connection manager
	and buffer. Also do a ref on the connection we get in
	inf_session_synchronize_to() because it will be unrefed when the
	synchronization is complete or failed.

2007-03-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Before removing the session from the
	connection manager in inf_session_release_connection(), make sure that
	the connection manager still has the connection. If the connection was
	closed, the connection manager might have dropped the connection
	earlier.

	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Refcount netobject
	registrations, but make sure objects are added with the same
	identifier.

2007-03-08  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-user.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-user.c: Added a connection field to InfUser
	specifiying a (not necessarily direct) connection between the local
	host and that user.

2007-03-07  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* docs/plugin: Added notes about the plugin interface. It is not yet
	implemented, these are my just ideas how it should work, so I do not
	forget and could be expanded to a complete specification later.

2007-03-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:OBJECT,DOUBLE and
	VOID:OBJECT,POINTER marshallers for synchronization signals.

	* libinfinity/inf-net-object.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.h:

	inner and outer queue, added enqueued vfunc in InfNetObject.

	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Implemented session synchronization.

	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.c: Minor build fixes.

	* libinfinity/docs/terminology: Added inner queue and outer queue of
	connection manager.

	* libinfinity/docs/session: Applied slight changes that came up during
	implementation.

2007-03-01  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/docs:
	* libinfinity/docs/terminology:
	* libinfinity/docs/session: Added some notes, mostly for me to not
	forget how things are supposed to work, but perhaps also interesting
	to others.

2007-03-01  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:BOOLEAN marshaller.

	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.c:
	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Added common buffer interface.

	* libinfinity/inf-text-buffer.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Changed prerequiste from GObject to
	InfBuffer.

2007-02-27  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinity/infd-directory.c: Added some directory API, but most
	implementations are still missing.

2007-02-27  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added marshallers required for
	InfTextBuffer.

	* libinfinity/inf-text-buffer.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-text-buffer.c:
	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Added InfTextBuffer interface.

	* libinfinited/inf-directory-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/inf-directory-storage.c: Added methods to read text
	notes, write ink and text notes, create a subdirectory and
	remove nodes.

2007-02-26  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Added
	inf_connection_manager_has_connection(). Also do strong refs instead
	of weak refs on added net object. This way, net objects are kept alive
	if there are still connections open. Especially, this should allow
	keeping sessions alive even if the document in the directory tree is
	removed.

	* libinfinited/infd-server.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-server.c:
	* libinfinited/Makefile.am: New server class managing acception of
	incoming connections and (yet to come) service publishing.

	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c: Implemented directory tree structure,
	but accessing background storage and handling client requests still
	missing.

2007-02-26  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:OBJECT marshaller.

	* libinfinity/inf-user.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-user.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c:
	* Makefile.am: Added InfUser and InfSession classes.

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Changed signal flags for the
	remove-stroke signal from G_SIGNAL_RUN_CLEANUP to G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST
	and surrounded the signal emission by a g_object_ref / g_object_unref
	pair. This way, the stroke should stay alive after having been removed
	from the buffer and signal handlers running after the default handler
	don't get corrupted memory.

2007-02-23  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-stroke.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-stroke.c: Renamed from InfStroke to
	InfInkStroke.

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Made an interface out of InfBuffer,
	renamed to InfInkBuffer.

	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Adjusted build rules for renamed files.

	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.c: Include inf-ink-buffer.h
	instead of inf-buffer.h, added text node type for upcoming
	collaborative text editing support, removed empty flag from node
	(client should query a node to check whether it is empty, this way it
	can also treat it as empty if it only contains nodes it is not
	interested in, for example a subdirectory containing only ink nodes
	will be shown empty in a text editor).

2007-02-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c: Added GNetworkTcpServer object, close
	on error.

2007-02-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Take a reference of the
	connection in inf_connection_manager_add_connection().

	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.c:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-marshal.in:
	* libinfinited/Makefile.am: Added interface for directory storage in
	libinfinited and initial directory class.

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac: Build libinfinited.

2007-02-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity: Renamed infinity directory to libinfinity.

	* configure.ac:
	* Makefile.am:
	* test/Makefile.am:
	* test/inf-test-xml-stream.c:

2007-02-20  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinity/inf-connection-manager.c:
	* infinity/inf-xml-stream.c: Chain up in destructor.

	* infinity/inf-buffer.h:
	* infinity/inf-buffer.c: Added InfBuffer class managing multiple
	InfStrokes.

	* infinity/inf-marshal.in: Added input file for glib-genmarshal.

	* infinity/Makefile.am: Create inf-marshal.h and inf-marshal.c from
	inf-marshal.in. Also added inf-buffer.c to build.

2007-02-20  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinity/inf-stroke.h:
	* infinity/inf-stroke.c: Added position to InfStroke to which
	the coordinates of the contained InfStrokePoints are relative.

2007-02-20  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinity/inf-xml-stream.c:
	* infinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Documentation fixes.

	* infinity/inf-net-object.c: Removed return in inf_net_object_sent()
	and inf_net_object_received() because these functions are void.

	* infinity/inf-stroke.h:
	* infinity/inf-stroke.c: Added object representing a single stroke.

	* infinity/Makefile.am: Added inf-stroke.c to build.

2007-02-19  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinity/inf-connection-manager.h:
	* infinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Implemented message processing

	inf-net-object.[ch].

2007-02-18  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinity/inf-netobject.h: Replaced INF_NET_OBJECT_TYPE by
	INF_TYPE_NET_OBJECT to follow gobject naming conventions.
