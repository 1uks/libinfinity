2007-02-26  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Added
	inf_connection_manager_has_connection(). Also do strong refs instead
	of weak refs on added net object. This way, net objects are kept alive
	if there are still connections open. Especially, this should allow
	keeping sessions alive even if the document in the directory tree is
	removed.

	* libinfinited/infd-server.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-server.c:
	* libinfinited/Makefile.am: New server class managing acception of
	incoming connections and (yet to come) service publishing.

	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c: Implemented directory tree structure,
	but accessing background storage and handling client requests still
	missing.

2007-02-26  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:OBJECT marshaller.

	* libinfinity/inf-user.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-user.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c:
	* Makefile.am: Added InfUser and InfSession classes.

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Changed signal flags for the
	remove-stroke signal from G_SIGNAL_RUN_CLEANUP to G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST
	and surrounded the signal emission by a g_object_ref / g_object_unref
	pair. This way, the stroke should stay alive after having been removed
	from the buffer and signal handlers running after the default handler
	don't get corrupted memory.

2007-02-23  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-stroke.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-stroke.c: Renamed from InfStroke to
	InfInkStroke.

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Made an interface out of InfBuffer,
	renamed to InfInkBuffer.

	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Adjusted build rules for renamed files.

	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.c: Include inf-ink-buffer.h
	instead of inf-buffer.h, added text node type for upcoming
	collaborative text editing support, removed empty flag from node
	(client should query a node to check whether it is empty, this way it
	can also treat it as empty if it only contains nodes it is not
	interested in, for example a subdirectory containing only ink nodes
	will be shown empty in a text editor).

2007-02-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c: Added GNetworkTcpServer object, close
	on error.

	* libinfinited/infd-marshal.in:
	* libinfinited/Makefile.am: Added interface for directory storage in

	* infinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Documentation fixes.

	* infinity/inf-net-object.c: Removed return in inf_net_object_sent()
