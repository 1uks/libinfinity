2007-03-07  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* docs/plugin: Added notes about the plugin interface. It is not yet
	implemented, these are my just ideas how it should work, so I do not
	forget and could be expanded to a complete specification later.

2007-03-06  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:OBJECT,DOUBLE and
	VOID:OBJECT,POINTER marshallers for synchronization signals.

	* libinfinity/inf-net-object.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-net-object.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Implemented separation between
	inner and outer queue, added enqueued vfunc in InfNetObject.

	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c: Implemented session synchronization.

	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.c: Minor build fixes.

	* libinfinity/docs/terminology: Added inner queue and outer queue of
	connection manager.

	* libinfinity/docs/session: Applied slight changes that came up during
	implementation.

2007-03-01  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/docs:
	* libinfinity/docs/terminology:
	* libinfinity/docs/session: Added some notes, mostly for me to not
	forget how things are supposed to work, but perhaps also interesting
	to others.

2007-03-01  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:BOOLEAN marshaller.

	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-buffer.c:
	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Added common buffer interface.

	* libinfinity/inf-text-buffer.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Changed prerequiste from GObject to
	InfBuffer.

2007-02-27  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinity/infd-directory.c: Added some directory API, but most
	implementations are still missing.

2007-02-27  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added marshallers required for
	InfTextBuffer.

	* libinfinity/inf-text-buffer.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-text-buffer.c:
	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Added InfTextBuffer interface.

	* libinfinited/inf-directory-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/inf-directory-storage.c: Added methods to read text
	notes, write ink and text notes, create a subdirectory and
	remove nodes.

2007-02-26  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Added
	inf_connection_manager_has_connection(). Also do strong refs instead
	of weak refs on added net object. This way, net objects are kept alive
	if there are still connections open. Especially, this should allow
	keeping sessions alive even if the document in the directory tree is
	removed.

	* libinfinited/infd-server.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-server.c:
	* libinfinited/Makefile.am: New server class managing acception of
	incoming connections and (yet to come) service publishing.

	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c: Implemented directory tree structure,
	but accessing background storage and handling client requests still
	missing.

2007-02-26  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-marshal.in: Added VOID:OBJECT marshaller.

	* libinfinity/inf-user.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-user.c:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-session.c:
	* Makefile.am: Added InfUser and InfSession classes.

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Changed signal flags for the
	remove-stroke signal from G_SIGNAL_RUN_CLEANUP to G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST
	and surrounded the signal emission by a g_object_ref / g_object_unref
	pair. This way, the stroke should stay alive after having been removed
	from the buffer and signal handlers running after the default handler
	don't get corrupted memory.

2007-02-23  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-stroke.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-stroke.c: Renamed from InfStroke to
	InfInkStroke.

	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.h:
	* libinfinity/inf-ink-buffer.c: Made an interface out of InfBuffer,
	renamed to InfInkBuffer.

	* libinfinity/Makefile.am: Adjusted build rules for renamed files.

	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.c: Include inf-ink-buffer.h
	instead of inf-buffer.h, added text node type for upcoming
	collaborative text editing support, removed empty flag from node
	(client should query a node to check whether it is empty, this way it
	can also treat it as empty if it only contains nodes it is not
	interested in, for example a subdirectory containing only ink nodes
	will be shown empty in a text editor).

2007-02-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.c: Added GNetworkTcpServer object, close
	on error.

2007-02-21  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* libinfinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Take a reference of the

	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.c:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-directory-storage.h:
	* libinfinited/infd-marshal.in:
	* libinfinited/Makefile.am: Added interface for directory storage in
	libinfinited and initial directory class.

	* infinity/inf-stroke.c: Added position to InfStroke to which
	the coordinates of the contained InfStrokePoints are relative.

2007-02-20  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@arbur.net>

	* infinity/inf-xml-stream.c:
	* infinity/inf-connection-manager.c: Documentation fixes.

	* infinity/inf-net-object.c: Removed return in inf_net_object_sent()
	and inf_net_object_received() because these functions are void.

	* infinity/inf-netobject.h: Replaced INF_NET_OBJECT_TYPE by
	INF_TYPE_NET_OBJECT to follow gobject naming conventions.
