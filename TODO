 * Unify InfIo interface (IO):
   - Rename InfIoFunc to InfIoWatchFunc
   - Split inf_io_watch into inf_io_add_watch, inf_io_update_watch and
     inf_io_remove_watch
 * Implement AdoptedLogRemoval correctly (Adopted)
 * Implement discovery via avahi (Discovery)
 * Create certificates if not given (XMPP)
 * Define masschat interface, implement for relay and jabber (Transport)
   - Yet unsure how relay is supposed to work.
 * Split InfXmppConnection (XMPP)
   - InfXmppConnection: XMPP core implementation
   - InfJabberConnection: Connection to jabber server, managing roster, presence, etc. Derives from InfXmppConnection, not used on server side
   - InfRawXmppConnection: InfXmlConnection implementation by sending raw messages to XMPP server (Derive from InfXmppConnection, make XMPP server create these connections (unsure: rather add a vfunc and subclass InfXmppServer?))
   - InfJabberUserConnection: Implements InfXmlConnection by sending stuff to a particular Jabber user (owns InfJabberConnection)
   - InfJabberDiscovery (owns InfJabberConnection)
 * Drop message table in Infc/dSession

 * Make Infc/dSession not inherit from InfSession:
   - Make close() a signal instead of a vfunc
   - Make the new Infc/dSession take a subscription group
     - in ctor for dSession
     - in set_connection for cSession
   - Make InfSession not implement NetObject anymore (but c/dSession) and
     just call a process_xml func.
   - Make InfSession take a group for initial sync and in synchronize_to() 
   - InfcBrowser, InfdDirectory do the following when creating a session:
     - Create subscription group (or synchronization group, if no subscription is performed)
     - Create session via Infc/dNotePlugin
     - Create Infc/dSession proxy with subscription group
