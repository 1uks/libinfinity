 * Unify InfIo interface (IO):
   - Rename InfIoFunc to InfIoWatchFunc
   - Split inf_io_watch into inf_io_add_watch, inf_io_update_watch and
     inf_io_remove_watch
 * Implement AdoptedLogRemoval correctly (Adopted)
 * Remove inf_adopted_operation_is_reversible and at this as another operation flag.
 * Implement discovery via avahi (Discovery)
 * Create certificates if not given (XMPP)
 * Split InfXmppConnection (XMPP)
   - InfXmppConnection: XMPP core implementation
   - InfJabberConnection: Connection to jabber server, managing roster, presence, etc. Derives from InfXmppConnection, not used on server side
   - InfRawXmppConnection: InfXmlConnection implementation by sending raw messages to XMPP server (Derive from InfXmppConnection, make XMPP server create these connections (unsure: rather add a vfunc and subclass InfXmppServer?))
   - InfJabberUserConnection: Implements InfXmlConnection by sending stuff to a particular Jabber user (owns InfJabberConnection)
   - InfJabberDiscovery (owns InfJabberConnection)

 * Unavailable users should not (be able to) have the INF_USER_LOCAL flag.
