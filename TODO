This is a more or less incomplete list of more or less independant tasks that
would be nice to have done for the first stable release.

Performance (Some ideas to improve performance, profile to verify!):
  * callgrind suggests g_object_new requires much time, especially for objects
    that are often instantianted, such as InfAdoptedRequest,
    InfTextDefaultInsertOperation and InfTextDefaultDeleteOperation. Maybe we
    can improve this by not initializing the member variables by properties,
    but by setting them after the g_object_new() call.
  * Move state vector helper functions in algorithm to InfAdoptedStateVector,
    with a better O(n) implementation.
  * Cache request.vector[request.user] in every request, this seems to be
    used pretty often.
  * Optionally compile with
    - G_DISABLE_CAST_CHECKS
    - G_DISABLE_ASSERT
    - G_DISABLE_CHECKS
    defined.

Modernization:
 * Use G_TYPE_ERROR for signals with an error parameter
 * Phase-out GTK2 support
 * Use g_get_monotonic_time where a time is needed
 * Generate gobject introspection annotations, typelibs and girs
 * Use GFile API for InfdFilesystemStorage
 * Use G_DEFINE_TYPE and friends
 * Replace constructor by constructed

Others:

 * Split InfXmppConnection (XMPP)
   - InfXmppConnection: XMPP core implementation
   - InfJabberConnection: Connection to jabber server, managing roster, presence, etc. Derives from InfXmppConnection, not used on server side
   - InfRawXmppConnection: InfXmlConnection implementation by sending raw messages to XMPP server (Derive from InfXmppConnection, make XMPP server create these connections (unsure: rather add a vfunc and subclass InfXmppServer?))
   - InfJabberUserConnection: Implements InfXmlConnection by sending stuff to a particular Jabber user (owns InfJabberConnection)
   - InfJabberDiscovery (owns InfJabberConnection)
 * Make InfTextChunk reference-counted, or implement copy-on-write semantics. It is currently copied way too often. (InfText)
 * Implement inf_text_chunk_insert_substring, and make use in InfTextDeleteOperation (InfText)
 * Add a set_caret paramater to insert_text and erase_text of InfTextBuffer and derive a InfTextRequest with a "set-caret" flag.
 * InfTextEncoding boxed type
 * Create a pseudo XML connection implementation, re-enable INF_IS_XML_CONNECTION check in inf_net_object_received
 * Add accessor API in InfGtkBrowserModel, so InfGtkBrowserView does not need to call gtk_tree_model_get all the time (which unnecssarily dups/refs)
 * Add append() and clear() virtual methods to InfTextBuffer. These may not have to be implemented since a default implementation can be used if no special one is provided, but it could help to speed up special operations. Make use in infd_note_plugin_text.
 * Allow split-operations of insert and delete operations to be made in one go, to atomically modify the document at many places at once
   * This can be used between begin-user-action and end-user-action, to keep the operation atomic on the infinote side
   * maybe need to evaluate whether a split operation which has insert as one child and delete as other child is handled correctly
     * definitely add more unit tests for this
 * Make InfLocalPublisher take a InfdXmlServer instead of a port number. Maybe
   even rename to InfPublisher, with InfDiscoveryAvahi assuming an
   InfdXmppServer. Or, consider simply removing the interface, and require
   people to use InfDiscoveryAvahi directly (check how well that works with
   InfdServerPool).
 * Make a InfcChat object that handles the chat session from InfcBrowser.
   InfcBrowser should relay messages to it, and if not handled by InfcChat,
   handle it by itself. InfcChat should be a public property of InfcBrowser,
   but handle all the chat stuff itself. Maybe implement
   InfCommunicationObject and still have the stuff relayed? Check again how
   the InfcBrowser->InfcSessionProxy->InfSession flow goes and do the same.
 * The same kind of thing should be implemented on the server side.
 * Make a common InfBrowserTree class which implements the basic tree structure
   commonly on client and server side.
 * Remove infc_browser_get_status() function
 * Change the storage interface to be asynchronous
   * take the chance and require gio
     * port the network code to gnio?
 * Change the request API so that requests can finish during the call to the
   main function. This would enable us to get rid of that horrible locreqs
   in InfdDirectory
