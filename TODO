This is a more-or-less incomplete list of more or less independant tasks that
would be nice to have done for the first stable release.

* Unify InfIo interface (IO):
   - Rename InfIoFunc to InfIoWatchFunc
   - Split inf_io_watch into inf_io_add_watch, inf_io_update_watch and
     inf_io_remove_watch
 * Implement AdoptedLogRemoval correctly (Adopted)
 * Implement discovery via avahi, implementing the existing interfaces (Discovery)
 * Create certificates if not given (XMPP)
 * Split InfXmppConnection (XMPP)
   - InfXmppConnection: XMPP core implementation
   - InfJabberConnection: Connection to jabber server, managing roster, presence, etc. Derives from InfXmppConnection, not used on server side
   - InfRawXmppConnection: InfXmlConnection implementation by sending raw messages to XMPP server (Derive from InfXmppConnection, make XMPP server create these connections (unsure: rather add a vfunc and subclass InfXmppServer?))
   - InfJabberUserConnection: Implements InfXmlConnection by sending stuff to a particular Jabber user (owns InfJabberConnection)
   - InfJabberDiscovery (owns InfJabberConnection)
 * Unavailable users should not (be able to) have the INF_USER_LOCAL flag set.
 * Allow operations to alter themselves while transforming (Adopted)
   - Severall classes currently assume operations are immutable.
 * Make InfTextChunk reference-counted, or implement copy-on-write semantics. It is currently copied way too often. (InfText)
 * Implement inf_text_chunk_insert_substring, and make use in InfTextDeleteOperation (InfText)
 * Add a selection_changed signal to InfTextBuffer and handle in InfTextSession
 * Add a set_caret paramater to insert_text and erase_text of InfTextBuffer and corresponding properties in the InfText operations, handle in InfTextSession.
 * Pass InfIo object to note plugins
 * InfTextEncoding boxed type
 * unconst "const GParameter* params" parameter to user_new vfunc because g_object_newv wants unconst
 * Create a pseudo XML connection implementation, re-enable INF_IS_XML_CONNECTION check in inf_net_object_received
 * Fix memory corruption in InfAdoptedRequestLog
 * Add gettext support
 * Add accessor API in InfGtkBrowserModel, so InfGtkBrowserView does not need to call gtk_tree_model_get all the time (which unnecssarily dups/refs)
 * Add append() and clear() virtual methods to InfTextBuffer. These may not have to be implemented since a default implementation can be used if no special one is provided, but it could help to speed up special operations. Make use in infd_note_plugin_text.
 * Make InfcExploreRequest derive from InfcNodeRequest. This saves some code duplication in InfcBrowser.
 * Don't use autoheader for the libinfinity/inf-config.h
