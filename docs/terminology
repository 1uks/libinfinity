directory
  The directory tree.

node
  An item in the directory tree.

root
  The root item of the directory tree.

subdirectory
  A node which contains child nodes.

note
  A leaf node.

connection
  A two-way connection between client and server.

explore
  This has meanings on two layers. In InfdDirectory, explore means to read
  a subdirectory from the background storage into memory ("explore the
  subdirectory").

  Also, a client can explore a subdirectory on the server. This means that he
  requests its content from the server and wants to be notified if content
  is added or removed.

buffer
  A document of a given type, for example a text buffer which holds text.

session
  A session manages real-time collaborative editing of a buffer.

user
  A user is a participant in a session.

available (user):
  An available user is a user that can actively perform changes in a buffer.

unavailable (user):
  An unavailable user has lost its connection to the server and so cannot
  edit the buffer.

local (user):
  A local user is a user that does not need a connection to the server to
  be available because it operates directly on the buffer the server uses.

subscribe
  A client can subscribe to a session on a server through a connection. This
  means that the session is first synchronized to the client (meaning the
  content of the underlaying buffer are transferred) and then the client
  gets notified about changes in the buffer.

  Note that the client cannot modify the buffer after having subscribed
  because it has no user in the session.

join
  A join (or user join) may be performed by a client after having subscribed
  to a session. This means that a new user for the session is created that
  belongs to that client so that the client can actually modify the buffer.
  It is also possible that an existing user that is unavailable is used
  instead of creating a new one. In this case, the join is also called a
  rejoin. Note that it is also possible that a client performs multiple
  user joins.
